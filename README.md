Requirements
========
Mac
-------
`brew install cmake`

Build
========

Install cmake (at least version 3.1)
Possibly some opengl requirements too

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

For Windows you open the visual studio project files instead of running `make`

To rebuild it all you need to do is
`cd build`
`make`
